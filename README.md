# merg-and-conflicts

"Merge" and "conflicts" are two terms commonly used in the project management field, particularly in the context of software development and version control management with systems like Git.

"Merge" refers to the action of combining two code branches or two sets of changes into one. This often occurs when a developer wants to integrate modifications they've made in one branch with modifications made in another branch.

"Conflicts" occur when there are discrepancies between modifications made to the same file or set of files by different individuals or branches. These discrepancies must be manually resolved by a developer during the branch merging process, as the version control system cannot automatically determine which version of the modifications should be kept.
